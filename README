INSTALLING FougTools

Create a file named _local_config.pri in folder qmake.build and put the
root path to the Boost library like this :

  BOOST_ROOT = /path/to/boost
  CONFIG *= occtools  # If you want to build occtools (optional)
  CONFIG *= use_oce   # If you want OpenCascade Community edition (OCE)

Or use script qmake.build/configure.rb

Note that :
  - Boost >= v1.40 is required
  - On Windows, qmake can complain about deprecated warnings for escape 
    characters. So you may have to double separator characters like
    C:\\path\\to\\boost

Then inside sub-folder qmake.build, type :
  qmake -r
  make (or nmake with Visual C++)


HOW TO REPORT A BUG

If you think you have found a bug in FougTools, we would like to hear
about it so that we can fix it. The FougTools bug tracking system is
open to the public at https://github.com/fougsys/fougtools/issues.

Before reporting a bug, please use the bug-tracker's search functions
to see if the issue is already known.

Always include the following information in your bug report: the name
and version number of your compiler; the name and version number of
your operating system; the version of FougTools you are using, and
what configure options it was compiled with.

If the problem you are reporting is only visible at run-time, try to
create a small test program that shows the problem when run.
